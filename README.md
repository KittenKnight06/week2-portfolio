## A lot of the research were done to make this webpage more presentable, especially on the CSS codings. 

### Tips: study and learn other developers codes and style will always bring new ideas.

## HTML structure

### Head + body + footer

#### Within body:

- Header contains the name, photo, and 4 options which will bring you to the relevant section of the body (Home, About me, Project, and Contact box).

- There are three buttons which will also take you to the relevant section of the body (project, contact, submit).

- Footer is linked to the linkedin profile.

- project picture size is 1.2 times larger when hover, and linked to the URL to demostrate.

## CSS

- Have created required classes with presentable styles to be referenced by the html file.

- Uses a mix of display like grid, block, inline-block, and flex along with responsive layout so the contents/pictures are adjusted by viewers' screen size.
